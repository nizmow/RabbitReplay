# OBSOLETE

I've given up on this -- what I wanted was an easy way to record and playback messages from a RabbitMQ message bus and replay them back for individual testing of microservices.

Turns out someone had already started more or less exactly what I wanted, and it's now very feature complete and satisfies most of my needs. Check out [rabtap](https://github.com/jandelgado/rabtap), it's amazing.

# RabbitReplay
Record and replay RabbitMQ traces using the RabbitMQ firehose.
